Python version       : 3.x

Indentation          : Use 3 spaces [ ] to indent a block / region, and do not
                          use tabs. (every editor has their separate defination
                          of tabs)
                       For all sub-blocks / sub-regions also, use 3 spaces [ ].

Functions            : In function declaration, the function name and
                          parenthesis [()] must be separated by only one space
                          [ ].
                       In function declaration and function calling, the
                          arguments must be separated by a comma [,] with space
                          [ ] as  [, ].
                       In function declaration, for default arguments, separate
                          the argument name and default value with an equal sign
                          [=] with spaces preceeding and succeeding the sign as
                          [ = ].
                       In function declaration, to denote absense of arguments
                          use empty parenthesis [()] without any spaces in
                          between.
                       During the function declaration, the colon [:] must
                          immediately follow parenthesis [()] as [():].
                       While calling functions, the parenthesis [()] must
                          immediately follow after function name.
                       Name the functions as per their function, with
                          camel-casing and first letter being upper case.

Return values        : If function returns a single value, simply return it as
                          is.
                       If function returns multiple values, put all values in
                          parenthesis [()], with a single space [ ] between the
                          'return' keyword and parenthesis [()].
                       If function returns multiple values, all return values
                          must be separated by a comma [,] with single space [ ]
                          as [, ], in the parenthesis [()].

List / array / dict  : To denote empty list / array / dict, use empty
                          parenthesis as per defination.
                       To separate multiple values, separate them using a comma
                          [,] with single space [ ] as [, ].
                       For last value, put an extra comma [,] only at the end of
                          list / array / dict.

Variable naming      : All variables must be named as per their role.
                       Do not use short forms for the variables, use full names.
                       All non-constant variables must start with lower-case
                          letter and should be written in all lower-case.
                       However, camel-casing can be used in naming varibles only
                          if it is required and makes sense, with the first
                          letter of variable being lower-cased.
                       All constant variables must be named in all upper-case.
                       In case of same name being fit for multiple names, name
                          all such variables by using an under-score [_]
                          between the variable name and any suitable identifier.
                       Do not use under-scores [_] in the start of variable
                          name unless the variable is private or protected.

Empty lines          : Separate two block by only a single line, with properly
                          indented spaces only.
                       Do not use only empty lines without indentation, if the
                          blocks above and below the line is indented.

Conditionals / loops : Use parenthesis [()] to write conditions for the
                          conditionals / loops.
                       A single space [ ] must be between the keyword and
                          parenthesis [()].
                       Colon [:] must immediately follow the parenthesis [()].
                       Use indented lines to separate the conditionals with
                          other blocks or regions.
                       Separate multiple conditions with only one space [ ]
                          and with appropriate use of parenthesis [()] and
                          keywords.

Classes              : All class names must begin with an upper-cased letter
                          with other letters being lower-cased.
                       However camel-casing is allowed in naming.
                       In case of inheritance, parenthesis [()] must be
                          separated from the class name using only one space
                          [ ].
                       If inheritance is not used, do not put empty parenthesis
                          [()].
                       The colon [:] must immediately follow the class name
                          (in case of no inheritance) or parenthesis [()]. (in
                          case of inheritance)
                       In case of multiple inheritance, separate the base
                          classes with a comma [,] followed with a single space
                          [ ] as [, ].
                       Use appropriate indentations.

Comments             : Use comments to put notes in a clean way in the program.
                       Use proper indentation while starting comment with hash
                          keyword [#], followed by a single space [ ] as [# ].
                       To indent comments in-line, use proper indentations with
                          sets of three spaces [   ] only, not tabs.
                       Try to put notes for most variable you use in a program.
                       Always put a commented note for the function with
                          function name and description, argument name and
                          it's short one lined description.

Additional notes     : Use built-in functions and methods wherever and whenever
                          possible, rather than defining your own.
