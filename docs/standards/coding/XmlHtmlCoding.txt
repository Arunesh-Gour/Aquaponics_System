Indentation       : Use 3 spaces [ ] to indent a block / region, and do not use
                       tabs. (every editor has their separate defination of
                       tabs)
                    For all sub-blocks / sub-regions also, use 3 spaces [ ].

Tags / attributes : Write html / xml tags in all lower-case, if possible.
                    Write the attributes in all lower-case as well.
                    For some special tags like '<!DOCTYPE>', write them in all
                       upper-case.

Empty lines       : Separate two block by only a single line, with properly
                       indented spaces only.
                    Do not use only empty lines without indentation, if the
                       blocks above and below the line is indented.

Comments          : Use comments to put notes in a clean way in the program.
                    Use proper indentation while starting comment with apt
                       start keyword [<!--], followed by a single space [ ] as
                       [<!-- ].
                    To indent comments in-line, use proper indentations with
                       sets of three spaces [   ] only, not tabs.

Additional notes  : Use built-in functions and methods wherever and whenever
                          possible, rather than defining your own.
