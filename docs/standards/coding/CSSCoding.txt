Indentation        : Use 3 spaces [ ] to indent a block / region, and do not
                        use tabs. (every editor has their separate defination
                        of tabs)
                     For all sub-blocks / sub-regions also, use 3 spaces [ ].

Selectors          : For filtered selectors, separate each sub-selectors by a
                        single space [ ] only.
                     For multiple selectors, separate each selectors by a comma
                        [,] followed by a space [ ] as [, ].

Blocks             : To start block by curly parenthesis [{}], put curly
                        parenthesis's start [{] on the same line as selectors
                        with a single space [ ] between them as [ {].
                     To end block by curly parenthesis [{}], put the curly
                        parenthesis's end [}] on a separate line with proper
                        indentation with parent block.

Empty lines        : Separate two block by only a single line, with properly
                        indented spaces only.
                     Do not use only empty lines without indentation, if the
                        blocks above and below the line is indented.

Comments           : Use comments to put notes in a clean way in the program.
                     Use proper indentation while starting comment with apt
                        keywords, followed by a single space [ ].
                     To indent comments in-line, use proper indentations with
                        sets of three spaces [   ] only, not tabs.

Additional details : Use short / efficient / apt notations wherever / whenever
                          possible.
                     Use semi-colon [;] at end of every property-value pairs,
                          without any space [ ] between the value and
                          semi-colon [;].
                     Keep values in single quotes ['] wherever available.
