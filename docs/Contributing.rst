What/How to contribute?
=======================
You can contribute to almost anything in the repository, from a typo in
READMEs to fixing any error/bug in code or introducing new features.
Just remember to follow a general flow of contributing to projects, which
could be found on internet.

While working in community projects, it is a good thing to ask other
contributors or any other people in community before working on any part of the
project like working on new features, bugs, issues, etc, which helps to know
if someone is already working on it or not.

Starting new part of project
============================
If you're starting work on a different software within a project even though
both are related, you should follow the procedure as given below.

1. Fetch **SRS** template from ``docs/standards/software/``.
2. Using the template, fill in all details for new software and put it in
   ``docs/software/``.
3. Create appropriate directory under ``src/`` and start working under the
   directory.

Pull requests
=============
1. Check with respective document / coding style under ``docs/standards/``.
2. Put appropriate summary in commit regarding what's changed/fixed, with
   more details in description.
3. Combine multiple commits into single then create new pull request.
4. You're done!
